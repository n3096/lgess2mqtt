# LG ESS Solar 2 MQTT (for e.g. Home Assistant)
This project provides a docker-container to read out data of LG ESS Home devices and communicate this with an MQTT broker - e.g. in an environment with **Home Assistant Container**.
If you have installed **Home Assistant Operating System**, you can simply use 3rd-party add-on integration like [Buktahula/hassio-addons/LG_ESS](https://github.com/Buktahula/hassio-addons/tree/main/LG_ESS).

## Preparations

### 1. Fetch the LG ESS password
1. Install Python on a Wi-Fi capable device\
Android: Install Pydroid 3 ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3))\ 
Windows/ Max/ Linux: See ([official Python docs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download))
2. Connect to the LG ESS Wi-Fi to fetch the device's password
3. Being in that Wi-Fi, open Python's **Terminal** (not _Interpreter_) and run these commands\
   `pip install pyess`\
   `esscli --action get_password`
4. Note down the LG ESS password, which you will find after the terminal response `INFO:pyess.cli:password: `

### 2. Install and configure an MQTT broker for e.g. Home Assistant
For Docker, you may use [eclipse-mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto).

### 3. Initial configuration
You need to provide a configuration file on _/etc/lgess2mqtt.conf_ to make this service run. 
Initially, you have to set all the following configuration properties.

```
ess_password = <your_ess_password>
mqtt_server = <your_mqtt_server>
mqtt_user = <your_mqtt_username>
mqtt_password = <your_mqtt_password>
```

## Run as a docker container
To ensure this docker container will run, you need to create the `essmqtt.conf` file shown above in [Initial Configuration](#3-initial-configuration) and mount it by the docker `volumes` mechanism.

### Example full docker-compose
```
version: '3.9'
services:
  lgess2mqtt:
    image: n3096/lgess2mqtt:latest
    container_name: lgess2mqtt
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - mqtt-broker
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /my/local/path/essmqtt.conf:/etc/essmqtt.conf:ro

  mqtt-broker:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:latest
    container_name: mqtt-broker
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '1883:1883'
      - '9001:9001'
    volumes:
      - /my/local/path/mqtt.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
      - /my/local/path/data/:/mosquitto/data/
      - /my/local/path/log/:/mosquitto/log/
```

## Home Assistant integration configuration
You can find all configuration options in [gluap/pyess#essmqtt-config-file](https://github.com/gluap/pyess#essmqtt-config-file).
The following will show concrete examples.

### Configure hass_autoconfig_sensors
This docker container and the MQTT-Broker should be running to look for the topic names.

All data, gathered from the LG ESS, is sent in the main topic "ess". By default, Home Assistant reads from the main topic "homeassistant", wherefore you should set the `hass_autoconfig_sensors` value. This will link the topic "homeassistant/sensor/esshomestatisticsbat_use" to the origin topic "ess/home/statistics/bat_use".
Finding out the possible data topics, you can use e.g. [MQTT Explorer Page](https://mqtt-explorer.com/), connect to your MQTT-Broker. Depending on the configuration, the data can be delayed up to the value of `interval_seconds` (default 10 seconds). You see all available topics, which may look similar to this:


![MQTT-Explorer topic example](/documentation-media/mqtt-explorer-topic-example.png)

### Full configuration file example
The topics names may vary considerably. Therefore, this is just an example. In the prior step [Configure hass_autoconfig_sensors](#configure-hassautoconfigsensors) you can find your provided topic names.
```
ess_password = myEssPassword
mqtt_server = 127.0.0.1
mqtt_user = myMqttUser
mqtt_password = myMqttPassw0rd

## Sensor (Home Assistant entity integration)
Here you can find a german example for the sensor configuration in Home Assistant Energy Dashboard: [/configurations/sensor.yaml](https://github.com/n3096/lgess2mqtt/blob/main/configurations/sensor.yaml) (copy of [Buktahuala/hassio-addons](https://github.com/Buktahula/hassio-addons/tree/main/LG_ESS/sensor.yaml))
