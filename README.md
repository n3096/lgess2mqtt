# LG ESS Solar 2 MQTT for e.g. Home Assistant

This project provides a docker-container to read out data of LG ESS Home devices and communicate this with a MQTT instance - e.g. in an environment with **Home Assistant Container**.
If you have installed **Home Assistant Operating System**, you can simply use 3rd-party add-ons like [hassio-addons/LG_ESS](https://github.com/Buktahula/hassio-addons/tree/main/LG_ESS).

## Sources

Python library for LG ESS Solar power converters with EnerVU app compatibility
from https://github.com/gluap/pyess in a Docker Container for Home Assistant.

## Requirements

### Fetch the device password
1. Install Python
 * Android: Install Pydroid 3 ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3 ) 
 * Windows/ Max/ Linux: See https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download
2. Connect to the LG ESS Wi-Fi to fetch the device's password
3. Being in that Wi-Fi open Python's **Terminal** (not Interpreter) and run these commands

   `pip install pyess`

   `esscli --action get_password`

4. Note down the ESS password after the terminal response `INFO:pyess.cli:password: `

### Install and configure MQTT broker for e.g. Home Assistant:
https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto

### Configuration File

You need to provide a configuration file on _/etc/lgess2mqtt.conf_ to make this service run.
```
ess_password = <your_ess_password>
mqtt_server = <your_mqtt_server>
mqtt_user = <your_mqtt_username>
mqtt_password = <your_mqtt_password>
# optional settings
## sensors for homeassistant MQTT discovery (default is not set -> homeassistant autoconfig disabled)
# hass_autoconfig_sensors = ess/common/BATT/soc,ess/home/statistics/pcs_pv_total_power,ess/common/GRID/active_power,ess/common/LOAD/load_power
## update interval for MQTT values in seconds (default is 10 seconds)
# interval_seconds = 10
## only send the values below common every n'th update of those for home
## this is a debugging option that shouldn't be required, (default is 1)
# common_divisor = 1
```

## Run the docker container
tbd

## Sensor (Home Assistant)
Here you can find a german example for the sensor configuration in Home Assistant Energy Dashboard: [/sensor.yaml](https://github.com/n3096/lgess2mqtt/blob/main/sensor.yaml) (copy of [Buktahuala/hassio-addons](https://github.com/Buktahula/hassio-addons/tree/main/LG_ESS/sensor.yaml))
